1. Filesystem Hierarchy
  / : The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nestled under this directory.
  /bin : Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.
  /boot : Contains kernel boot loader files.
  /dev : Device files
  /etc : Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.
  /home : Personal directories for users, hold your documents, files, settings, etc.
  /lib : Holds library files that binaries can use.
  /media : Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.
  /mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.
  /opt : Optional application software packages.
  /proc : Information about currently running processes.
  /root : The root user's home directory.
  /run : Information about the running system since the last boot.
  /sbin : Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.
  /srv : Site-specific data which are served by the system.
  /tmp : Storage for temporary files.
  /usr : User installed software and utilities. Inside this directory are sub-directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local,etc.
  /var : Variable directory, it's used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Basically anything that is subject to change all the time.

2. Filesystem Types
  Jouranling : Log file(journey)
  Common Desktop Filesystem Types
    ext4 (Common linux filesystem type)
    btrfs
    XFS
    NTFS and FAT
    HFS+
  df -T : Reports file system disk space usage and other details about your disk

3. Anatomy of a Disk
  Partition Table
  Partition
    MBR (Master Boot Record)
    GPT (GUID Partition Table)
  Filesystem Structure
    Boot block 
    Super block
    Inode table
    Data blocks
  sudo parted -l
  Extended partition type is used to create more than 4 partitions in the MBR partitioning scheme.

4. Disk Partitioning
  fdisk - basic command-line partitioning tool, it does not support GPT
  parted - this is a command line tool that supports both MBR and GPT partitioning
  gparted - this is the GUI version of parted
  gdisk - fdisk, but it does not support MBR only GPT

  Launch parted - sudo parted
  Select the device - select /dev/sdb2
  View current partition table - sudo parted -l
  Partition the device - mkpart primary 123 4567 [mkpart type start_point end_point]
  Resize a partition - resize 2 1245 3456
    Select the partition number and then the start and end points of where you want to resize it to.

5. Creating Filesystems
  sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb2
    Make filesystem tool allows us to specify the type of filesystem we want and where we want it.

6. mount and unmount
  First create the mount point, in our case mkdir/mydrive
    sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb2 /mydrive
      -t : specifies the type of filesystem
  To unmount
    sudo umount /mydrive
    OR
    sudo umount /dev/sdb2
  To view the universally unique ID (UUID) on your system for block devices
    sudo blkid

  sudo mount UUID=120b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76 /mydrive

7. /etc/fstab
  To automatically mount filesystems at startup 
  cat /etc/fstab
    UUID=130b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76 /               ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1

UUID=78d203a0-7c18-49bd-9e07-54f44cdb5726 /home           xfs     relatime        0       2
      UUID = Device Identifier
      Mount Point = Directory the filesystem is mounted to
      Filesystem type
      Options = other mount options
      Dump = used by the dump utility to decide when to make a backup, you should just default to 0
      Pass = Used by fsck to decide what order filesystems should be checked, if the value is 0, it will not be checked.

8. swap
  Using a partition for swap space
  Let's say we wanted to set our partition of /dev/sdb2 to be used for swap space.
    First make sure we don't have anything on the partition
    Run: mkswap /dev/sdb2 to initialize swap areas
    Run: swapon /dev/sdb2 this will enable the swap device
    If you want the swap partition to persist on bootup, you need to add an entry to the /etc/fstab file. sw is the filesystem type that you'll use.
    To remove swap: swapoff /dev/sdb2

9. Disk Usage
  df -h
    df : shows the utilization of your currently mounted filesystems. (how much of disk is free)
    -h : gives you a human readable format
  du -h
    du : shows the disk usage of the current directory

10. Filesystem Repair
  fsck : Used to check the consistency of a filesystem and can even try to repair it for us.
  sudo fsck /dev/sda

11. Inodes
An inode (index node) is an entry in this table and there is one for every file.
  File type : regular file, directory, character device, etc.
  Owner
  Group
  Access permissions
  Timestamps - mtime (time of last file modification), ctime (time of last attribute change), atime(time of last access)
  Number of hardlinks to the file
  Size of the file
  Number of blocks allocated to the file
  Pointers to the data blocks of the file - most important!
df -i
ls -li
stat ~/Desktop/

12. symlinks
  ls -li
  Symlinks allow us to link to another file by its filename.
    echo 'myfile' > myfile
    ln -s myfile myfilelink
    ls -li

  ln myfile2 myhardlink
  ls -li
  A hardlink just creates another file with a link to the same inode
  Creating a symlink : ln -s myfile mylink
  Creating a hardlink : ln somefile somelink
