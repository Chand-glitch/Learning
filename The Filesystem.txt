1. Filesystem Hierarchy
  / : The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nestled under this directory.
  /bin : Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.
  /boot : Contains kernel boot loader files.
  /dev : Device files
  /etc : Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.
  /home : Personal directories for users, hold your documents, files, settings, etc.
  /lib : Holds library files that binaries can use.
  /media : Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.
  /mnt : Temporarily mounted filesystems.
  /opt : Optional application software packages.
  /proc : Information about currently running processes.
  /root : The root user's home directory.
  /run : Information about the running system since the last boot.
  /sbin : Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.
  /srv : Site-specific data which are served by the system.
  /tmp : Storage for temporary files.
  /usr : User installed software and utilities. Inside this directory are sub-directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local,etc.
  /var : Variable directory, it's used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Basically anything that is subject to change all the time.

2. Filesystem Types
  Jouranling : Log file(journey)
  Common Desktop Filesystem Types
    ext4 (Common linux filesystem type)
    btrfs
    XFS
    NTFS and FAT
    HFS+
  df -T : Reports file system disk space usage and other details about your disk

3. Anatomy of a Disk
  Partition Table
  Partition
    MBR (Master Boot Record)
    GPT (GUID Partition Table)
  Filesystem Structure
    Boot block 
    Super block
    Inode table
    Data blocks
  sudo parted -l
  Extended partition type is used to create more than 4 partitions in the MBR partitioning scheme.
