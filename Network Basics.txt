1. Network Basics
  ISP - Internet Service Provider
  Router - Allows each machine on the network to connect to the Internet.
  WAN - Wide Area Network, the network that encompasses everything between your router and a wider network such as the internet.
  WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network, the network between your router and any wireless devices you may have such as laptops.
  LAN - Local Area network, this is the network between your router and any wired devices such as Desktop PCs.
  Hosts - Each machine on a network is known as a host.

2. OSI Model
3. TCP/IP Model
  Protocols work together to specify how data should be gathered, addressed, transmitted and routed through a network.
  1. Application Layer
    It determines how your computer's programs (such as your web browser) interface with the transport layer services to view the data that gets sent or received.
    This layer uses:
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - used for the webpages on the Internet.
    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - electronic mail (email) transmission
  2. Transport Layer
    includes checking the correct ports, the integrity of the data, and basically delivering our packets.
    This layer uses:
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - reliable data delivery
    UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - unreliable data delivery

  3. Network Layer
    This layers specifies how to move packets between hosts and across networks.
    This layer uses:
    IP (Internet Protocol) - Helps route packets from one machine to another.
    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - Helps tell us what is going on, such as error messages and debugging information.

  4. Link Layer
    This layer specifies how to send data across a physical piece of hardware.

4. Network Addressing
  MAC Addresses
    Hardware address
    When you want to get access to the internet, your machine needs to have a device called a Network Interface Card. This network adapter has its own hardware address that's used to identify your machine. 
    For example, Dell has 00-14-22, so a network adapter from Dell could have a MAC address like: 00-14-22-34-B2-C2. 

  IP Addresses
    Used to identify device on a network

  Hostnames
    Hostnames take your IP address and allow you to tie that address to a human readable name. Instead of remembering 192.12.41.4 you can just remember myhost.com.
