1. Tracking processes : top
  1st line:
  The fields are from left to right:
    1. Current time
    2. How long the system has been running
    3. How many users are currently logged on
    4. System load average
  2nd line : Tasks that are running, sleeping, stopeed and zombied
  3rd line : CPU Information
    1. us: user CPU time - Percentage of CPU time spent running users' processes that aren't niced.
    2. sy: system CPU time - Percentage of CPU time spent running the kernel and kernel processes
    3. ni: nice CPUT time - Percentage of CPU time spent running niced processes
    4. id: CPU idle time - Percentage of CPU time that is spent idle
    5. wa: I/O wait - Percentage of CPU time that is spent waiting for I/O. If this value is low, the problem probably isn't disk or network I/O
    6. hi: hardware interrupts - Percentage of CPU time spent serving hardware interrupts
    7. si: software interrupts - Percentage of CPU time spent serving software interrupts
    8. st: steal time - If you are running virtual machines, this is the percentage of CPU time that was stolen from you for other tasks
  4th and 5th line : Memory Usage and Swap usage
    1. PID : Id of the process
    2. USER : user that is the owner of the process
    3. PR : Priority of the process
    4. NI : The nice value
    5. VIRT : Virtual memory used by the process
    6. RES : Physical memory used from the process
    7. SHR : Shared memory of the process
    8. S: Indicates the status of the process: S=sleep, R=running, Z=zombie, D=uninterruptible, T=stopped
    9. %CPU: this is the percent of CPU used bu this process
    10. %MEM : percentage of RAM used by this process
    11. TIME+ : total time of activity of this process
    12. COMMAND : name of the process
top -p 1
