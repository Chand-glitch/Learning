    Character Device
      These devices transfer data, but one a character at a time.
    Block Device
      These devices transfer data, but in large fixed-sized blocks.
    Pipe Device
      Named pipes allow two or more processes to communiccate with each other
    Socket Device
      Socket devices facilitate communication between processes, 
    Device Characterization
    Major device Number
        Represents the device driver 
    Minor device Number
        Tells which unique device it is in this driver class

3. Device Names
  SCSI Devices
    Small Computer System Interface
    Protocol used for allowing communication between disks, printers, scanners and other peripherals to your system.
    /dev/sda - First hard disk
    /dev/sdb - Second hard disk
    /dev/sda3 - Third partition on the first hard disk

  Pseudo Devices
    Not really connected to your system
    /dev/zero - accepts and discards all input, produces a continuous stream of NULL (zero value) bytes
    /dev/null - accepts and discards all input, produces no output
    /dev/random - produces random numbers

  PATA Devices
    Older devices
    /dev/hda - First hard disk
    /dev/hdd2 - Second partition on 4th hard disk

4. sysfs
  A virtual filesystem, most often mounted to the /sys directory.
  Detailed information on devices.
  ls /sys/block/sda

5. udev
  mknod /dev/sdb1 d b 3
    To make node
  udevadm info --query=all --name/dev/sda
    To view information for a device

6. lsusb, lspci, lssci
  lsusb => listing usb devices
  lspci => listing pci devices
  lssci => listing SCSI devices

7. dd
  For converting and copying data
  It reads input from a file or data stream and writes it to a file or data stream.
  dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024
    This command is copying the contents of backup.img to /dev/sdb
    It will copy the data in blocks of 1024 bytes
    if=file - Input file, read from a file instead of standard input
    of=file - Output file, write to a file instead of standard output
    bs=bytes - Block size, it reads and writes this many bytes of data at a time.
    count=number - Number of blocks to copy
  dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=2
