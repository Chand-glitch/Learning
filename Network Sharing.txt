1. File Sharing Overview
  To copy a file over from local host to a remote host
    scp myfile.txt usrname@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
  To copy a file from a remote host to your local host
    scp username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory/myfile.txt /local/directory
  To copy over a directory from your local host to a remote host
    scp -r mydir usrname@remotehost.com:/remote/directory

2. rsync
  Rsync uses a special algorithm that checks in advanced if there is already data that you are copying to and will only copy over the differences.
  It also verifies the integrity of a file you are copying over with checksums.
  Some commonly-used rsync options:
    v - verbose output
    r - recursive into directories
    h - human readable output
    z - compressed for easier transfer, great for slow connections

  Copy/sync files on the same host
    rsync -zvr /my/local/directory/one /my/local/directory/two
  Copy/sync files to local host from a remote host
    rsync /local/directory username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
  Copy/sync files to a remote host from a local host
    rsync username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory /local/directory

3. Simple HTTP Server
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
      http://IP_ADDRESS:8000
      http://localhost:8000
    python -m http.server

4. NFS
  Allows a server to share directories and files with one or more clients over the network.

  Setting up NFS client
    sudo service nfsclient start
    sudo mount server:/directory /mount_directory
