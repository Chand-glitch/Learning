1. System V Overview
  The main purpose of init is to start and stop essential processes on the system.
  0 : shutdown
  1: Singler User Mode
  2: Multiuser mode without networking
  3: Multiuser mode with networking
  4: Unused
  5: Multiuser mode with networking and GUI
  6: Reboot
  The scripts are located in /etc/rc/d/rc[runlevel number].d or /etc/init.d

2. System V Service
  List services => service --status-all
  Start a service => sudo service networking start
  Stop a service => sudo service networking stop
  Restart a service => sudo service networking restart

3. Upstart Overview
  ls /etc/init
  Way that upstart works:
  1. First, it loads up the job confifurations from /etc/init
  2. Once a startup event occurs, it will run jobs triggered by that event.
  3. These jobs will make new events and then those events will trigger more jobs
  4. Upstart continues to do this until it completes all the necessary jobs

4. Upstart Jobs
  View jobs => initctl list
  View specific job => initctl status networking
  Manually start a job => sudo initctl start networking
  Manually stop a job => sudo initctl stop networking
  Manually restart a job => sudo initctl restart networking
  Manually emit an event => sudo initctl emit some_event

5. Systemd Overview
  Systemd uses goals to get your system up and running. 
  Typical systemd boot:
    1. First, systemd loads its configuration files, usually located in /etc/systemd/system or /usr/lib/systemd/system
    2. Then it determines its boot goal, which is default.target
    3. Systemd figures out the dependencies of the boot target and activates them
  Systemd boot target:
    poweroff.target - shutdown system
    rescue.target - single user mode
    multi-user.target - multiuser with networking
    graphical.target - multiuser with networking and GUI
    reboot.target - restart
  The main object that systemd works with are known as units. The most common units are:
    service units - these are the services we've been starting and stopping, these unit files end in .service
    Mount units - these mount filesystems, these unit files end in .mount
    Target units - these group together other units, the files end in .target

6. Systemd Goals
  List units - systemctl list-units
  View status of unit - systemctl status networking.service
  Start a service - sudo systemctl start networking.service
  Stop a service - sudo systemctl stop networking.service
  Restart a service - sudo systemctl restart networking.service
  Enable a unit - sudo systemctl enable networking.service
  Disable a unit - sudo systemctl disable networking.service

7. Power States
  To shutdown your system : sudo shutdown -h now
                            sudo shutdown -h +2
  To restart : sudo shutdown -r now
               sudo reboot
