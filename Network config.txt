1. Network interfaces
  ifconfig -a
  To create an interface and bring it up
    $ ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
  To bring up or down an interface
    $ ifup eth0
    $ ifdown eth0
  To show interface information for all interfaces
    ip link show
  To show the statistics of an interface 
    ip -s link show eth0
  To show ip addresses allocated to interfaces 
    ip address show
  To bring interfaces up and down
    ip link set eth0 up
    ip link set eth0 down
  To add an IP address to an interface
    ip address add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0

2. route
  Add a new route
    sudo route add -net 192.168.2.1/23 gw 10.11.12.3
  Delete a route
    sudo route del -net 192.168.2.1/23
  To add a route
    ip route add 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3
  To delete a route
    ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23 via 10.11.12.3
    or
    ip route delete 192.168.2.1/23

3. dhclient
  The dhclient starts up on boot and gets a list of network interfaces from the dhclient.conf file.
  In the dhclient.leases file, dhclinet keeps track of a list of leases across system reboots, after reading dhclient.conf, the dhclient.leases file is read to let it know what leases it's already assigned.
  sudo dhclient

4. Network Manager
  nm-tool => reports NetworkManager's state and it's devices
  nmcli => allows you to control and modify NetworkManager

5. arp
  arp => To view the locally stored ARP cache on our system 
  If we send a packet to a destination that isn't in the ARP cache, the following happens:
    The source host creates the Ethernet frame with an ARP request packet
    The source host broadcasts this frame to the entire network
    If one of the hosts on the network knows the correct MAC address, it will send a reply packet and frame containing the MAC address
    The source host adds the IP to MAC address mapping to the ARP cache and then proceeds with sending the packet
  ip neighbour show
